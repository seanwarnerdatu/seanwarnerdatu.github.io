          He's very attentive to details especially when it comes to design that I'm visualizing for my website to make it more appealing to the eyes of the audience. 
          He's very open to communicating the problems and end up having a solution to it.
          I highly recommend Warner as he makes high quality and meeting the client's standard works."

          He also takes on challenging development and learns the complexities of what I wanted for the back-end development.

          <p>"Warner has dedication on his works, he is also a solutionist on getting the job done. 
            He is easy to talk to, friendly and open minded. Could a problem come in, either minor or major task backing down is not an option for Warner. 
            To him life is like a game, you can win or lose but the game is over when you stop playing. 
            And that's how hardworking he is. Warner could stay up all night finishing a project. 
            He is a team player, and could work better and harder, and plan along his group. 
            Him and I worked so hard on a project, and as long as it goes according to plan we would finish the task."</p>
